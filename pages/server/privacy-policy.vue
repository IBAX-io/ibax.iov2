      <strong>In Short:</strong>
      We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other
      than your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our servers are located in sydney. If you are accessing our Website from
      outside sydney, please be aware that your information may be transferred
      to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third
      parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR
      INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in Australia, India, United
      States, United Kingdom, and other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United
      Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data
      protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your
      country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your
      personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable
      law.
    </p>
    <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
    <p>
      We have implemented measures to protect your personal information,
      including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses
      for transfers of personal information between our group companies and
      between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all
      recipients to protect all personal information that they process
      originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection
      laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided
      upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our
      third-party service providers and partners and further details can be
      provided upon request.
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h6>

    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than 2 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>We aim to protect your personal information
      through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
      storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
      access the Website within a secure environment.

    <h6 class="title-h6">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h6>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.

    <p>Verification process</p>
    <p>
      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
      determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
      our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
      information so that we can match it with information you have previously
      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
      will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
      verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and
      for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
      additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

        no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data
      </li>
      <li>
        you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA
        on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does
        not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
        behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
      </li>
      <li>
        you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal
        information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we
        will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later
        than 15 days from the date of the request submission.
